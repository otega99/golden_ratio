      <h1>The Golden Rectangle</h1>
      <p>
        The Golden Rectangle , also called the perfect rectangle by some, is a
        rectangle in which the ratio of its length to its width is the Golden
        Ratio . Many believe that this is one of the most visually pleasing of
        all geometric shapes. It appears in many works of art and architecture.
        The Parthenon of ancient Greece is the most famous example of the use of
        the golden rectangle. People find the golden rectangle in the Mona Lisa,
        and other Renaissance art works. If you start with a Golden Rectangle,
        you can divide it into a square and another Golden Rectangle. You can
        then repeat this pattern with each succeeding smaller rectangle.
