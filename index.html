      <h1>The Golden Ratio</h1>
      <p>
        The golden ratio, also known as the golden section, golden mean, or
        divine proportion, is the irrational number (1 + Square root of√5)/2,
        often denoted by the Greek letter ϕ or τ, which is approximately equal
        to 1.618. It is the ratio of a line segment cut into two pieces of
        different lengths such that the ratio of the whole segment to that of
        the longer segment is equal to the ratio of the longer segment to the
        shorter segment. The origin of this number can be traced back to Euclid,
        who mentions it as the “extreme and mean ratio” in the Elements.
